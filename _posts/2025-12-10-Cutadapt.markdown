This page explains the process of Trimming NGS Reads on the HPC.

# Prerequisites:
- Before you begin, make sure you have followed the [[Software Installation (HPC)]] guide.
- Make sure you have [[Uploading Files to the HPC|uploaded]] the files to the HPC.
- [`cd`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/cd-command-in-linux-with-examples/) to the directory containing the fastQC read files.

## Step1: Download the slurm script
```
# Download the download script
wget -O trimmer.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rakhapu-T/NGS-HPC-processing.io/refs/heads/main/scripts/trimmer.sh"
```

## Step2: Setup email + Append your cutadapt command:

#### Open the Slurm script for editing:
```
nano trimmer.sh
```

#### Using the keyboard arrows, scroll to the bottom of the and find the following:
```
# >>>>>>>>>> Enter your email address here to get job status emails <<<<<<<<<<<<
# ==============================================================================
#SBATCH --mail-user="example.uct.ac.za"
# ==============================================================================
```
- Change `example.uct.ac.za` to your email.
#### Scroll to the bottom of the file and paste your cutadapt command.
Example:
```
##################################################################

cutadapt -j 8 \
		 -a TCCCAGATTATATCTAT \
         -o Trim3endA11_3.fastq \
         MAS651A11_S11_L003_R1_001.fastq
```
- **Assume that the number of cores (CPUs) is 8.**
- **See:** [[Cutadapt cheetsheet]] for how to format your commands.
#### Save the changes and close the file
1. press: `ctrl + s` (This saves the file)
2. press: `ctrl + x` (This closes the file)

## Step3: Run Script
#### Activate the environment:
```
source activate cutadapt
```

#### Run the script:
```
sbatch trimmer.sh
```

## Step5: Verify Results
```
# Check if trimmed files are available
ls -lh
```

#### Deactivate the Environment when finished
```
conda deactivate
```
